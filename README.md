You can draw on the canvas by clicking and dragging the mouse.
Save the code below in an HTML file (e.g., drawing_app.html) and open it in your web browser to use the drawing app

In this example, we use the HTML canvas element to create a drawing area. The startDrawing function sets a flag when the mouse is clicked, and the draw function draws lines as the mouse is moved while holding the click. When the mouse is released or moves outside the canvas, drawing stops.
Feel free to play around with the code and customize the drawing app further based on your preferences. You can change the line color, line width, or add additional features like different colors, clear button, etc., to make the app more interactive and fun.
